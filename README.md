As I begin my ticket management process, I will focus on practicing the creation, triaging, and resolution of various tickets. To gain better insights into efficiently managing multiple tickets, I plan to watch the instructional video on ticket triaging.

Here are some ticket examples I'll be working with:

Sev-A Ticket: The entire mobile/online banking system is down, requiring immediate attention from SysAdmins. This ticket is of high severity and requires a response within one hour, 24/7.

Sev-B Ticket: The accounting department is facing issues with a broken Adobe upgrade. This ticket has a medium severity and should be resolved within four hours, 24/7.

Sev-B/C Ticket: The CFO's laptop is experiencing slowdowns. This ticket has a medium-to-low severity and is limited to business hours, requiring a response and resolution within two hours.

</p>
<p>
Following the guidelines, I will triage each ticket based on its severity and impact on the users and systems. High-severity tickets like Sev-A will be immediately escalated to the SysAdmin team for urgent resolution.

Next, I will address the Sev-B ticket concerning the accounting department's Adobe upgrade. I will prioritize this ticket as it has a medium severity and work on resolving the issue within the specified time frame.

<p>
Moving on to the Sev-B/C ticket, which involves the CFO's laptop performance, I will carefully assess its impact and severity. Since it falls under the business hours category and has a medium-to-low severity, I will handle this ticket during the designated time frame and troubleshoot the laptop's performance issues accordingly.

Throughout this process, I will ensure proper documentation of each ticket, its current status, and the steps taken to resolve it. Additionally, I will communicate with users and stakeholders as needed, providing updates and seeking feedback to ensure customer satisfaction.

By following this ticket management process and utilizing the insights gained from the video on ticket triaging, I aim to improve my efficiency in handling multiple tickets and delivering prompt solutions to users' technical issues.
